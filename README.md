## compat-wireless-2010-06-26-p.tar.bz2

Use this file when you are trying to run aircrack-ng, airmon-ng, and iwconfig on your Kali Linux VM from a Macbook localhost.

### Problem this solves:

I'm running Kali Linux in VirtualBox on a macbook.

Trying to test wifi security tools like aircrack-ng, airmon-ng, and iwconfig but there is no wlan0 network (because of Macbook hardware)

### How to use:

- Download this file to your Kali Linux box and cd to its location

- `tar -xjvf compact-wireless-2010–06–26-p.tar.bz2`

- `cd compat-wireless-2010–06–26-p`

- `make load`

### Verify it's working correctly

- `ifconfig` # should show you wlan0 and wlan1

- `iwconfig` # should show you your wireless networks
